            <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Melanoma is the third most common cancer affecting Australians. It can be treated and if done so quickly
                can prevent further spread. My project idea is to use machine learning trained on a database of skin conditions 
                that can be used as a triage device to quickly identify the likelihood of a mole being malignant and taking 
                the correct course of action based upon this. I believe this could be used by nurses and other medical 
                professionals when deciding whether to order a biopsy and pathology report. This could also be useful 
                in remote areas where access to dermatologists may be limited. While there are some legal considerations
                to look at here I believe that if distributed correctly this could be an exceptional tool for identifying 
                potentially cancerous growths before they spread.
            </p>
            <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                In 2020 it is predicted that 15,691 Australians will be diagnosed with some form of melanoma and between 2010 and 2014
                there were 55,128 diagnosed with this form of cancer. While some moles can be determined malignant or benign by a general
                practitioner simply looking at them, many doctors will refer patients to a dermatologist before ordering an invasive 
                biopsy and pathology report. If it was possible for a computer to determine the likelihood of this biopsy returning a 
                positive result by analyzing the image using machine learning after having been trained by hundreds of thousands of 
                images and diagnoses this could save valuable time and resources for the medical industry and their patients.

            <p>           
                Fortunately this is currently possible with technology that is already available. There is currently already an 
                <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6091241/">enormous 
                    database </a>of these sorts of conditions which could be used to train the machine learning algorithm. This could be done 
                with some creative software development and would simply work as an android application. All that would be required is 
                an android device with a camera to give a percentage of likelihood result with a simple point and click of the devices 
                camera. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The features of this app would be incredibly simple to use and could be distributed in two different formats. 
                A consumer format of this application could simply be used for people to send images off to a medical professional 
                who could then use the medical format of the application to analyse the image as well as their own eye to determine 
                whether a patient should come in for a biopsy. This would be vastly beneficial to those living in remote areas who are 
                not always able to see a doctor face to face. This could also track any potential growth of a mole over time by taking 
                multiple photographs at set increments. This could prevent a huge number of melanoma that is currently going undiagnosed
                all over the world and could make sure that at risk people can catch these conditions before they have spread, 
                while they are at their most treatable stage.
            </p>
            <p>
                The patient side of the application would consist of a basic menu to get in touch with a medical professional and submit
                an image or a series of images. It would use push notifications to prompt the user to take another photo at set intervals. 
                The patient could also schedule appointments with medical professionals around the world to diagnose the skin condition 
                to its fullest extent and then treat it. This would put thousands more in touch with doctors.
            </p>
            <center>
                <img src="imgs/example.png" style="height: 350px;" alt="example app image">
            </center>
            <p>
                The medical professional side of the application would send the participating doctor the image with an analysis by the 
                artificial intelligence. This would be in form of a percentage of match to a malignant skin tumour. The doctor could then
                analyse the image further and either make a decision on the spot, schedule an appointment with the patient or request more
                images. Once a diagnosis is made the doctor would record the data in the app which would continue to train the AI model.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe it is important that the AI analysis be only offered to a doctor as there could be legal implications of people 
                not being treated based on a misdiagnosis of a mole. This could be for a number of reasons such as the image being too blurry
                to identify. A trained human eye would also be required in the work flow of a diagnosis using this application. 
                This is why the app would have be used simply as a triage aid for doctors rather than a fully customer facing app that 
                would diagnosis the condition for you. It is not intended to replace the human component of this process just simply as an aid.

            </h2>
            The tools required for this job would be as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Weka:</b> This is a fantastic AI/ML training tool created by a university in New Zealand that allows for you to make a 
                    detailed aritificial intelligence model by training it on a data set and then testing it with another dataset. 
                    You are required to have the expected results for this to work.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>JavaML:</b> This is a Java library that can be used with the above results to apply the AI model to new data. 
                    This would work with Android applications considering they are written in Java
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Java: </b>Of course to program android apps Java or Kotlin is the current go to language. This is why would I would 
                    suggest to be used for this as there are a number of AI/ML tools that work with Java as well.
                </li>
                <li><b>Android/Android Studio: </b>The operating system and IDE that this would initially run on/ be built with.

                Skills Required
            </h2>
            Some of the skills required would be:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Medical professional to advise the best way to design the app and make it as useful as possible end devise the
                    best way to get doctors to adopt the app.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Legal professional to ensure professional indemnification against the potential legal issues of the app.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A strong understanding of artificial intelligence and machine learning. There are a number of professionals 
                    in this field now and the amount of knowledge available online in this specialty is enormous. I have had 
                    success in training an AI model to recognize new images of cats and dogs. While this would require a much 
                    larger data set due to the intricacy I believe it is achievable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Software development skills with Android and Java. This is something that I am capable of and use at work daily.
                    While we are becoming potentially more rare with emerging languages taking over we still exist!
                </li>
                <li>
                    UI/UX Design skills. There would need to be two easy to use user interfaces to make this app successful
                </li>
                <li>
                    Database/ Big Data knowledge. Large amounts of sensitive data would need to be handled. This would have
                    to be done perfectly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Security professional: while it may seem like a despicable thing to do there is the potential for something 
                    like this to be hacked. It would need to be air tight.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="outcome">
                Outcome
            </h2>
            <p>
                The outcome of this would be an amazing tool that could be used by medical professionals and patients internationally. 
                This could dramatically increase the early detection rate of this potentially deadly cancer that affect so many of 
                our loved ones. This would be a not for profit endeavour and could result in lives saved all over the world. It would 
                require early adoption by some medical professionals however there is nothing like this on the market and I believe 
                it would be welcomed with open arms. The app would be availble for free download by patients on the app store and 
                the professional version of the app would be distributed as an apk package to the participating doctors. Technology
                can help the world in so many ways and wherever possible it should!
