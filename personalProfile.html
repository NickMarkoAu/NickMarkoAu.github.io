            <p>I had a lot of fun with this. I have a strong interest in human psychology, particulary my own. I decided to spend
                a bit of money on a detailed Myers-Briggs test as I have wanted to do this for some time and I got some fantastic insights
                from it. Let me share a few with you below. To begin with...</p>
            <h3>Myer-Briggs Test</h3>
            <h4>My Result</h4>

            <p>
                ENFP is considered a "people-centered creator". I would agree with that as a short analysis. I love to create and I
                do certainly take into account with those around me. Fortunately this report goes into great detail and there are
                some really interesting things that popped out to me from it. For a start I certainly wouldn't consider myself completely
                extroverted and this report agreed.
            </p>
            <h4>Some interesting statistics about my own personality I found from doing this test</h4>

            <p>As I said I don't believe I am 100% extaverted. I certainly enjoy a certain amount of time to myself.
                This was an interesting statistic</p>

            <p>I also found this worth noting. I definitely prefer to work in a creative way and rely on my imagination to come up with
                the ideas that I implement into the software I create at work.</p>

            <p>The report also came with this in depth analysis of each element that it tested for. This was a really interesting task
                and worth spending a bit of money for a full report.</p>
