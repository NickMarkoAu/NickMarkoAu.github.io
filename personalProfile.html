            <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
            <p>I had a lot of fun with this. I have a strong interest in human psychology, particulary my own. I decided to spend
                a bit of money on a detailed Myers-Briggs test as I have wanted to do this for some time and I got some fantastic insights
                from it. Let me share a few with you below. To begin with...</p>
            <h3>Myer-Briggs Test</h3>
            <center>

            <p>
                ENFP is considered a "people-centered creator". I would agree with that as a short analysis. I love to create and I
                do certainly take into account with those around me. Fortunately this report goes into great detail and there are
                some really interesting things that popped out to me from it. For a start I certainly wouldn't consider myself completely
                extroverted and this report agreed.
            </p>
            <h4>Some interesting statistics about my own personality I found from doing this test</h4>
            <center>

            </center>
            <p>As I said I don't believe I am 100% extraverted. I certainly enjoy a certain amount of time to myself.
                This was an interesting statistic</p>
            <center>
                <img src="imgs/intuition.PNG" style="width: 55%" alt="imaginative">
            </center>
            <p>I also found this worth noting. I definitely prefer to work in a creative way and rely on my imagination to come up with
                the ideas that I implement into the software I create at work.</p>

            </center>
            <p>The report also came with this in depth analysis of each element that it tested for. This was a really interesting task
                and worth spending a bit of money for a full report.</p>

            <h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
            <center>
                <img src="imgs/visualLearner.png" style="width: 55%" alt="visual learner">
            </center>
            <p>My learning style test was from <a href="training.com.au">training.com.au</a>. It showed that I am a visual learner which I 
                definitely agree with. I like to see charts and graphs to make decisions and can extrapolate the information I need from these mediums easily
                Once I see how something is done I can apply it.
            </p>

            <h3>Creativity Test</h3>
            <center>
                <img src="imgs/creativityScore.PNG" style="width: 55%" alt="creativity score">
            </center>
            <p>My creativity score was from <a href="http://www.testmycreativity.com/">testmycreativity.com</a> I found that I was pretty close
                to typical on this front which was a bit surprising however I was leaning towards curiosity. I like to try to stay away from the 
                way things are always done and come up with new ways to do things which I think shows a level of curiosity.</p>
            <h2>What does this mean to me?</h2>
            <p>
                Taking all these results into account this means a number of things. I believe that my curiosity can be made a strong suit 
                however it has its down falls and I need to be aware of this. I need to make sure that I don't overlook a solution to a
                problem specifically to do it in a different way. I think that I need to make sure that I don't let procrastination get the better
                of me while learning and try to stick to a schedule as best as I can as these can be seen as downfalls of my personality type.
                While I have known for a while that visual learning is the best way for me to retain information I will keep this in mind and
                make sure to create visual stimulus whenever possible during work and study.
            </p>
            <h2>How will this affect group work?</h2>
            <p>
                I believe my personality will allow me to work well in groups. I like to initiate discussions and open the floor to conversation about
                new ideas so I will keep this in mind while doing group work. Understanding how people work together and recognising others emotions will
                be key in keeping the peace in a group. Creating personal relationships with all the people in my team will be something that I ensure
                to do with this knowledge in mind. Encouraging creative thinking and out of the box ideas is a strength and I will play into this.
                I need to make sure that I am open to opposing ideas and criticism to make sure that I can put my best work forward and work with others
                in the team effectively.
            </p>
            <h2>Taking this into account while forming a team</h2>
            <p>
                Ensuring a diverse group of individuals in a group is important especially when it comes to personality types however this knowledge
                can also help to make sure there won't be personality clashes within a group. I believe I would look for other somewhat extraverted people
                to work with that will be open to communication within the group. I think getting a group member that is on the other end of the personality
                spectrum would help with keeping organised and maintaining order and schedule such as an ISTJ or ESTJ. I will certainly keep this information
                in mind at work and during my time studying to make sure my whole team gets the most out of our group work together.
