            <h2>My Interest In IT</h2>
            <p>
                My interest in technology started at a very young age. When I was 8 years old my parents bought me a 
                computer game for our Windows 98 IBM PC that required the gamer to use BASIC to solve problems and 
                progress the story line. From here I absolutely fell in love with code, the creativity that it 
                allowed and the endless possibilities that it opened doors to. Since then I have always had a close 
                relationship with software development from developing websites for clients during high school years to 
                submitting a complete video game as my HSC final project for my IT class.</p>

                Years later I am working as a software developer for a snow tourism company. I primarily code web 
                applications using a tech stack that consists of but is certainly not limited to Java, JavaScript 
                (including Angular, React, Node, jQuery, etc.) , HTML and CSS. This has been a dream and an opportunity 
                that has even further developed my love for IT.

                I have now decided it's time to get a degree in my field. I want to learn industry standards (as I
                am mostly self taught), upcoming technology, and further develop my coding skills. I am hoping to 
                advance my career and find opportunities to broaden my technical horizons.

                One technology that particularly interests me is artificial 
                intelligence (specifically machine learning). I have found some uses for this already on a business
                level and would like to be part of the advancement of this tech in the future. I firmly believe 
                that technology can change the world even further than we have ever imagined and continues to 
                do so on a day to day basis.
