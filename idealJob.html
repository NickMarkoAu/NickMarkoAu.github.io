            <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
            <p>
                I strongly believe that my ideal job hasn't been advertised yet because it doesn't exist yet. 
                Technology is moving at such a fast pace and ideally I would always like to be at the forefront, cutting edge of
                technological advancement. If I had to choose a job that is currently advertised I think Google would be a great fit.
                They experiment and work in an innovative and advanced space that with an enourmous amount of funding allows for them to
                keep at the top of their game with new technology.</p>

                While technology is currently at the core of human evolution I expect by the time I finish this degree there will be
                hundreds of thousands of new positions that we couldn't currently even dream of that will be invented. I hope to bring my
                software development skills up to this level so that I will be in a position to take these jobs as they are introduced. If
                I was at this level tomorrow; here would be my my dream job. While there are thousands of innovating companies I would be thrilled to work
                with, the funding behind Google as well as the culture and lifestyle that comes with their employment makes this a top job on my radar.

            <h3>Position Description</h3>
            <p>
                To be an innovator for Google would involve working with cutting edge technology on a day to day basis. Designing and developing
                their many web applications, android applications and API technology. The main appeal would be creating applications that are used
                by so many people. For example to work on the Google Maps application. There would be millions of people using this daily and you
                would be directly impacting their lives by creating new features in an application like this. You would be working with a team of
                world class innovators making the technology the keeps the world going around. The new AI that Google just released at their last
                conference as part of the Google assistant technology is incredible and it would be fantastic to be innovating at this level.
            </p>
            <h3>Skills and Qualifications</h3>
            <p>
                Most Google software development positions prefer you to have a masters degree in computer science or equivalent. This degree is my
                first step to work towards that. Also as a software developer for Google languages such as Kotlin and the JS framework Angular are
                key pieces of knowledge. I can currently write Kotlin and am in the process of learning Angular.
            </p>
            <p>
                I currently program in more than 10 languages and have a strong understanding of devOps and CI/CD. I have developed great tech
                communication skills with people whether they have a knowledge of technology or not. I can work as a self starter on projects with
                direction from technical documentation and have more than 3 years experience working as a software developer.
            </p>
            <h3>Plan</h3>
            <p>
                This degree is the first step for me to obtain these skills. I will follow this closely with a masters degree. I am currently in the
                process of learning the languages Google regularly uses however with the speed that technology currently changes it is more than
                likely that the languages will change in the near future. I will continue to stay as up to date as possible with my software
                development knowledge to make myself as employable as possible for companies like Google.
