            <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
            <p>
                I strongly believe that my ideal job hasn't been advertised yet because it doesn't exist yet. 
                Technology is moving at such a fast pace and ideally I would always like to be at the forefront, cutting edge of
                technological advancement. If I had to choose a job that is currently advertised I think Google would be a great fit.
                They experiment and work in an innovative and advanced space that with an enourmous amount of funding allows for them to
                keep at the top of their game with new technology.</p>

                While technology is currently at the core of human evolution I expect by the time I finish this degree there will be
                hundreds of thousands of new positions that we couldn't currently even dream of that will be invented. I hope to bring my
                software development skills up to this level so that I will be in a position to take these jobs as they are introduced. If
                I was at this level tomorrow. Here would be my my dream job. While there are tonnes of companies I would be thrilled to work
                with, the funding behind Google and the lifestyle that comes with their employment makes this a top job on my radar.
